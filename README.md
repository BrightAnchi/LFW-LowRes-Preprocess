# LFW Low-Resolution Preprocessing

This repository contains preprocessing scripts and datasets for generating low-resolution versions of the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.  
It is designed for experiments in face recognition with degraded input quality, especially for use with super-resolution models such as StarSRGAN.
